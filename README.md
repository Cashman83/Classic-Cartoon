Welcome to the Classic Cartoon IPTV Project! This repository hosts playlists for classic cartoon series that can be streamed on IPTV software or media players like Kodi, VLC, and other compatible platforms.
About the Project

The purpose of this project is to make classic cartoons more accessible and enjoyable for fans around the world. By using publicly available media links, weâ€™ve compiled playlists of beloved shows for nostalgic entertainment.
Features

    Classic Cartoons: Playlists include series such as Centurions, Flintstones, Wacky Races, and more.
    Stream Compatibility: These playlists are formatted for use with IPTV software and media players like Kodi, VLC, or any M3U-compatible platform.
    Free to Use: All content is publicly available and sourced from platforms like Archive.org.

Live Stream for Centurions is active at - rtmp://152.42.249.99/live/centurions

Have managed to get FFMPEG to talk to the text file. This stream is live and continuous you can view or start your own stream using the m3u. Will work to add some other channels soon.

    Download and install VLC Media Player.
